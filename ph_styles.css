Below, I've linked my fonts in a selector, which, using the fonts that my client has sent me, will display those pages, because I've put them in a font-family, and linked them inside of urls to the text files given to me. TrueType is just the format for .ttf files, while .woff is the format for woff files. At the moment, I am unsure if I need to keep the font families in the same font face or not. I'll check back later to make sure there are different fonts where needed.

To set my background color here, I use hsl; hue, saturation, lightness. This affects the background to the color set by the hue color, and the strength of the color and brightness of the color, represented by a percentage value. The hue value, however, is set on a color wheel value, and doesn't need percent value.

Here, the padding can be a little bit confusing to the untrained eye. The first value of the padding, 5px, is to the first value, which is the top value. Imagine that the next values are clockwise of the first value, and that corresponds to the next side. 25px is set to the right, bottom, and left respectively. I also tried using 5px, 25px, 25px, since if the two values are the same, you can leave one blank (Or, if you want the same amount of padding all around, one value is all you need.) However, I found that it would look better and cleaner if I put in all the values.

There is a lot going on in this tag, so I'll try to break it down. Font-style is usually a property which allows text to be either normal, italic, or oblique. Font-size is a property which is measured in em's, which is relative to a browser, but can also be measured in pixels, or percentages(which is ill advised relative to the other options given to us. Text align moves the text to the middle of the page in a horizontal line. Padding effects the top and the bottom of the page, while setting the sides to 0 px.
